# Exodus Church Demo website

This is a demo site I made to learn vue.
It uses:
- vue
- Tailwind
- Nuxt
- Nuxt UI
- Nuxt Content

## Customizing
I don't intend for others to clone the site but If you do want to customize then
you contents then you can start by editing the [composables folder](/app/composables)
and [content](/content) folder.

You can also import it into Nuxt Content to use a visual editor.
