At the Exodus church, we're big on community and every member feels known and loved.

We believe in achieving great things as a family and fulfilling prophesies together as the
body of Christ.
<br />
<br />
We have small nuclear families called cells where everyone knows his/her neighbour well.

We also give everyone an opportunity to serve the Lord in groups called service units.
