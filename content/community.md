At the Exodus church, we're big on community and every member feels known and loved.

We believe in achieving great things as a family and fulfilling prophesies together as the
body of Christ.

:br

We have small families called cells where everyone truly feels like their a part of something
and we give everyone an opportunity to serve the Lord in groups called service units.
