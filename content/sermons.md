      What is the BURDEN of REDEMPTION?

      The crux of redemption is not the cross alone, but the crossing of souls from
      spiritual death to salvation. This and more we explore as we see what truly
      happened on the cross and what's happening now in our world through belivers today.

      A MASSIVE HARVEST awaits us.

      Taught in OCTOBER, - PRAYER FOCUSED. 

      We reveal different flavours in prayer that would help your prayer life and devotion to God.

      How well do we know prayer and its potency. 

      4 SOLID SERMONS on different aspects of prayer.

      Part 1 - Growing in grace.  We show how every believer is called to and can grow in grace, and become more effective in christ.

      Part 2- Being Vulnerable with God in prayer. How can we be vulneable in the place of prayer and pour out our hearts to him. Our God is a God of refuge.

      Part 3- Long and short prayers- As a believer should i only pray long? or short prayers? is there power in short prayers? is there power in long prayer. is one more effective than the other?

      Part 4-Praying in line with the will of God as a believer(a very important teaching)

      It's a supernatural time ahead!üî•
