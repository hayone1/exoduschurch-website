      Bible Study in the Kingdom. Taught with the focus on Acts1:3-4.
      Luke’s summary of Jesus’ 40 day teaching upon his resurrection.
      “Speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God”.
      This teaching would bring clarity on how to study Gods word.
      And what truly is the essence of Bible study in the Kingdom.

      What is the BURDEN of REDEMPTION?


      The crux of redemption is not the cross alone, but the crossing of souls
      from

      spiritual death to salvation. This and more we explore as we see what
      truly

      happened on the cross and what's happening now in our world through
      belivers today.


      A MASSIVE HARVEST awaits us.


      This was taught post supernatural school december 2023 after a glorious
      time in God's

      presence as a follow up teaching to lead us in the passion of CHRIST.

      What did Jesus mean in Luke 24:49? It should be listened to alongside

      “Bible study in the Kingdom”. Showing us the vitality of tongues in
      Ministry.

      Where is the “on high” ? What happened in Acts 2? These and more would be
      clarified.

      DAVID SAID,

      Psa 139:15  My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in
      secret,

      intricately woven in the depths of the earth.

      Psa 139:16  Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were
      written,

      every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was
      none of them.


      We explore the will of God as we learn and discover more of God's plan for
      our

      lives everyday through his positioning, personal Challenges, Projects,
      Wisdom,

      Prayers, Decisions, Favour and more. 


      God's BOOK

      PROJECTS

      PREPARING FOR A NEW YEAR.


      We hope it blesses you as you prepare for FRESH SEASONS.

      We study carefully. The concept of Foreknowledge. What exactly is
      foreknowledge. Predestination and Election?

      These teaching series explore the concept of foreknowledge and
      predestination. 


      It’s the first series. With 2 more to come.


      (With more emphasis on ELECTION.)


      Follow closely. It would reshape your concept of Grace.

      Examining the events in Genesis1-3 carefully and how Moses writes Genesis.
      This would shape our understanding of these concepts. It’s not to be
      rushed. It’s a careful Teaching.

      Heartbeats - Intimacy with the holy spirit
      

      Get ready to be introduced into an understanding of fellowship with the
      person

      of the holy spirit as we see the ministry of the holy spirit in our
      hearts.

      Who is the holy spirit, where is he, what is he doing in our lives. We get
      to really

      see what scripture teaches about his person and his operation in our
      lives. What does

      'intimacy with the holy spirit' really mean?


      - Good morning holyspirit: He helps our infirmities.

      - He is the reality of scripture: and the breath

      - He helps our sanctification: tearing the flesh into the spirit.

      - Can i lose the holy spirit: is my heart beating?

      Make haste to help me!!

      The words David spoke in pslams 70.

      There are moments where it seems like the help of God is far.

      And all we can think of like David is. Lord help me speedily !


      The favour of God is real and it can help a man !

      The Help of God, hand of God and grace of God is real and can be walked
      in!

      really usher us into fresh seasons and experiences and testimonies. 

      This was taught in August. But caused a shift and we sense to release it

      this season as we cross into the new year.

      In New Seasons


      Whether naturally or supernaturally, a lot of us are entering new seasons.
      Some may be changing jobs, just getting into or out of relationships,
      going in NYSC, starting university or something else entirely. There is a
      tendency to be afraid, to shift into new seasons but what does God say
      about new seasons? What are the tools you need in new seasons, how do you
      supernaturally identify them?


      How do I identify SEASONS AND SHIFTS in my life. These and more we receive
      answers to in this teaching. It will equip you with wisdom in approaching
      new seasons, in being sensitive with the times and seasons

      We reveal different flavours in prayer that would help your prayer life
      and devotion to God.


      How well do we know prayer and its potency. 


      4 SOLID SERMONS on different aspects of prayer.


      Part 1 - Growing in grace.  We show how every believer is called to and
      can grow in grace, and become more effective in christ.


      Part 2- Being Vulnerable with God in prayer. How can we be vulneable in
      the place of prayer and pour out our hearts to him. Our God is a God of
      refuge.


      Part 3- Long and short prayers- As a believer should i only pray long? or
      short prayers? is there power in short prayers? is there power in long
      prayer. is one more effective than the other?


      Part 4-Praying in line with the will of God as a believer(a very important
      teaching)


      It's a supernatural time ahead!🔥

      Feeling weak? There is hope!


      Job 14:7  For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will
      sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.

      Job 14:8  Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock
      thereof die in the ground;

      Job 14:9  Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth
      boughs like a plant.


      There is hope!
