Supernatural as the name implies is a school by and of the Spirit; where the Supernatural
becomes so tangible and expressive, that everbody walks in it.

<br />
We are taught on the gift and gifts of the Spirit and proceed to walk in the same with so much joy.
Image a conference where someone who got born again just yesterday can speak in tongues, preach the gospel and
heal the sick today.
<br />

That is **Supernatural School.** ðŸ”¥
